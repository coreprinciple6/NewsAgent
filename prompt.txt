Editorial Guide: Style, Coverage & Prioritization
This guide provides a clear framework for our editorial strategy. It outlines the types of stories we prioritize and those we avoid, and it includes a simple, objective system for tagging and ranking articles to ensure our content remains focused, consistent, and relevant to our B2B audience.
Part 1: Editorial Style & Scope
Our newsletter is a B2B digest for professionals in the fragrance and beauty industry. The goal is to report on the "why" behind industry happenings, focusing on business strategy, market dynamics, and emerging trends.
Core Coverage Pillars: What We Cover
1. Fragrance as a Primary Focus This is our most important and frequently covered category. We track it from every angle.
* Market & Category Growth: Report on fragrance being the fastest-growing beauty category[cite: 62, 77], often outpacing skincare[cite: 77].
* Consumer Behavior: Detail the influence of Gen Z[cite: 62, 66, 78], the rise of "fragrance wardrobes"[cite: 67, 121], and the popularity of layering and discovery sets[cite: 63, 322].
* New Launches: Feature new products from a wide range of brands, including major celebrity lines (Drake, Ice Spice) [cite: 115, 268] and artisanal/niche houses (Marc-Antoine Barrois)[cite: 111].
* Category Expansion: Cover the trend of brands extending into adjacent products like body sprays[cite: 353], hair mists[cite: 63, 78], and home scents transitioning to personal fragrances[cite: 115].
2. The Business of Beauty We go beyond product announcements to analyze the financial and strategic moves shaping the industry.
* Financial Reporting: Summarize quarterly earnings from major corporations like L'Oréal[cite: 42], Puig[cite: 206], and Shiseido[cite: 284].
* Industry Deals (M&A and Funding): Report on acquisitions, such as Church & Dwight's purchase of Touchland[cite: 295], and funding rounds for emerging brands like Gente[cite: 57].
* Retailer Performance: Analyze the success and struggles of key retailers, including Bluemercury's consistent growth[cite: 163, 172, 330], the decline of Sephora's sales events[cite: 93], and the collapse of partnerships like J.C. Penney and Thirteen Lune[cite: 336].
3. Macro-Economic and Geopolitical Impacts We connect global events directly to the beauty industry.
* Tariffs and Supply Chain: This is a major, recurring theme. We cover the impact of U.S. tariffs on pricing[cite: 48, 129], brand strategy[cite: 51, 130], contract negotiations[cite: 201], and the exploration of nearshoring manufacturing to places like Mexico[cite: 276].
4. Retail and Marketing Strategy Evolution We track how and where brands are selling their products and connecting with customers.
* Channel Dynamics: Detail the strategies of major retailers like Ulta [cite: 36, 159] and Sephora[cite: 34], while also giving significant attention to the disruptive impact of TikTok Shop [cite: 64, 90] and Amazon's growing dominance[cite: 35, 97].
* Marketing and Engagement: Focus on innovative marketing tactics, such as experiential pop-ups (Gisou, Patrick Ta)[cite: 86, 238], brand collaborations (Bubble x Olive & June)[cite: 155], and strategic partnerships with non-traditional players like the WNBA[cite: 28, 326].
* The Power of AI: We cover the practical application of AI in the industry, from virtual try-ons and personalization [cite: 218] to tools that fight counterfeits [cite: 372] and predict consumer behavior[cite: 373].
5. Key Consumer and Product Trends We identify the key shifts in consumer behavior and product development.
* Gen Z as a Driving Force: Analyze their spending habits[cite: 66], brand preferences[cite: 69], and influence on categories like fragrance [cite: 62] and sustainable body care[cite: 20].
* The "Skinification" of Beauty: Report on the trend of body care[cite: 318], makeup[cite: 168], and hair care adopting sophisticated, science-backed ingredients typically found in facial skincare.
* Beauty and Wellness Convergence: Cover the blurring lines between beauty and health, including ingestibles[cite: 53], wearable wellness devices[cite: 5], and the growth of intimate care categories[cite: 106].
What We Don't Cover
To maintain our B2B focus, we consciously avoid certain types of content.
* Hard Science or Formulation Deep Dives: We will mention that a product is "science-backed"[cite: 172], but we do not provide detailed explanations of chemical formulations.
* Consumer-Facing Content (Reviews, Tutorials): We do not write product reviews from a first-person perspective or publish "how-to" guides for achieving specific looks.
* Celebrity Gossip: When covering a celebrity brand launch, our focus is exclusively on the business strategy [cite: 117] and retail partners[cite: 115]. We do not report on their personal lives.
* DIY Beauty: Our content is focused on the commercial beauty market.
* Detailed Legislative Analysis: We report on the business impact of regulations like tariffs[cite: 47, 366], but we do not delve into the granular details of the legislative process itself.

Part 2: Article Tagging & Priority Scoring System
This system provides a simple, objective method for categorizing every article and assigning it a priority score. This helps determine an article's importance and placement within the newsletter.
The Tagging System
Every article gets one Primary Tag that defines its main subject and multiple Secondary Tags that add factual detail.
Primary Tags (Choose ONE per article)
* FRAGRANCE: The main subject is personal fragrance, home fragrance, the fragrance market, or a scent-focused brand.
* BRAND: The main subject is a specific beauty brand's strategy, launch, or rebrand (and it is not primarily about fragrance).
* RETAIL: The main subject is a retailer (Sephora, Ulta), an e-commerce platform (TikTok Shop, Amazon), or a retail strategy/event.
* INDUSTRY: The main subject is a macro-level topic, such as M&A, financial reports, supply chain issues, or regulations affecting the broader market.
* MARKETING: The main subject is a specific marketing campaign, a partnership, or an activation.
* OTHER: The main subject does not fit into any of the above categories.
Secondary Tags (Choose ALL that apply)
* New Launch
* Financials
* M&A
* Tariffs/Supply Chain
* Retail Strategy
* Gen Z
* TikTok
* Partnership
